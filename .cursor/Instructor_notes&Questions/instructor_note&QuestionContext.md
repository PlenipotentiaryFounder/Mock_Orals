‚úÖ What We‚Äôre Doing
We are systematically building a ground knowledge database for Private Pilot training ‚Äî specifically for use in instructional tools like mock orals, AI tutors, flashcards, or lesson planning.

Each element in the Airman Certification Standards (ACS) ‚Äî like PA.IX.C.K1 ‚Äî represents a specific knowledge point a student pilot is expected to understand. These elements fall under ACS tasks (like "Emergency Operations ‚Äì System Malfunctions").

For each element, we are creating:

Instructor Notes:

Short, authoritative teaching points that explain the concept.

Tied to FAA references (e.g. AFH, PHAK, POH, regulations).

Designed to be useful for CFIs in instruction or debriefings.

Stored in the instructor_notes table.

Sample Questions:

Oral exam-style questions that assess understanding of the element.

Simple and clear, used for mock orals or AI-generated quizzes.

Stored in the sample_questions table.

SQL Inserts:

These populate the Supabase database with the structured data for each element.

The element_id (like PA.IX.C.K1) is used as the key for each associated note and question.

üß† Why This Matters
Standardization: By aligning each note and question to a specific ACS element, we ensure consistent training across instructors, students, and AI systems.

Comprehensiveness: Students can see every relevant question and concept tied to each standard ‚Äî no surprises on checkride day.

Instructional Efficiency: Instructors can use this system to guide lessons, mock orals, and remediation more efficiently and with confidence that it‚Äôs ACS-aligned.



‚úÖ Element: PA.IX.C.K1
Area: Emergency Operations
Task: Systems and Equipment Malfunctions
Code: PA.IX.C.K1
